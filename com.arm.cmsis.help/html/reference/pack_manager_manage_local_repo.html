<h2>
      Using Local Repositories
</h2>

<p>All versions of installed packs are stored below the pack root folder
(refer to <a href="pack_manager.html">CMSIS Pack Manager</a>). While developing a software pack, it is useful to have
direct access to its content without the need to re-build and re-install the pack after modifications. For this
purpose, you can add the folder of a pack's local copy by selecting
<img src="../images/manage_local_repo.png" class="uvicon"> <b>Manage Local Repositories...</b> and pressing
<b>Add...</b>. Select the PDSC file in the folder and press <b>OK</b>:</p>

<img src="./images/manage_local_repos.png" alt="Manage Local Repositories">

<p>Using the <b>Remove</b> button, you can remove local repositories from the list.</p>

<p>The plugin does not make a difference between local repositories and installed packs. If a version of a pack is
provided as an installed pack and a local repository, only the content from the local repository is used.</p>
<p>Changes to the PDSC file of a local repository are not notified to running Eclipse instances. To reload the PDSC
file, use the <img src="../images/refresh_packs.png" class="uvicon"> <b>Reload Packs</b> button.</p>
